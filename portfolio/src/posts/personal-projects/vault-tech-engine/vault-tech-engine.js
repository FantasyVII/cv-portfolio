        description={`Description: Vault-Tech was my first game engine that I built on top of XNA using C#. The engine supported multi-threaded A* path-finding using my own job system. The engine supported tiled based rendering and had a tile map editor. The engine only rendered what was present on the screen. 
        
The engine supported both TCP and UDP protocols which were used with a client/server architecture. The engine supported SQL communication to upload data to a database.

Technology: XNA/MonoGame, Winsock2, SQL, C#
        
Platforms: Windows`}
